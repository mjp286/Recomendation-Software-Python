# Recommendation Software Python
 Codecademy project

This is a project in the Codecademy CS102 course. It is a simple program to recommend music playlists based on user input.
The user should run the Main.py file. The program will give a list of music genres that the user can select from. The user types the genre they would like to see, and a list of songs is generated. The songs are from Rolling Stone magazines's Top 500 songs.
